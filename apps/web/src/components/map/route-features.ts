 * Pure map-data helpers for per-day route lines (Trip Workspace V2.5 — Routing).
 * Split from MapPanel so they're testable without a DOM or maplibre: one builds
 * the `LineString` source (the data layer), the other builds the `line-color`
 * paint expression (the style layer).
 *
 * A day's route is the road/footpath polyline through that day's ordered stops,
 * tinted by which day it belongs to so adjacent days read as distinct ribbons on
 * the canvas. The per-day filter mirrors the pin layer: it rebuilds the
 * FeatureCollection at the DATA level off a `hiddenDays: Set<string>` of ISO
 * dates (the same toggle the pins honour), rather than fighting MapLibre filters.

 * tellable-apart day to day. These are RAW hex on purpose: MapLibre paint CANNOT
 * read CSS custom properties, so — exactly like {@link PIN_FALLBACK_COLOR} in
 * pin-tint.ts — the line colors live as literals here, not as `--var` tokens.
 * The first entry shares the pin fallback's terracotta so a one-day trip's line
 * sits in the same family as its pins.

 * alone — the nested expression as-is (already well-formed; its own empty guard
 * means a zero-branch match is never produced at any level), or a constant
